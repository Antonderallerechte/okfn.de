Digitally networked technologies bring new opportunities for civil society: Citizens can exercise their rights more easily and obtain better information about what the government is doing. 

We promote fact-based political discourse. We develop software, provide infrastructure and promote open source projects. We experiment and offer a field of experimentation for others.
