The Open Data Incubator Europe supported start-ups with up to 100,000 euros, whose business models are based on the use of open data. A total of 5.5 million euros were available in eight calls to promote the Open Data Ecosystem in Europe. ODINE has thus supported the next generation of digital companies and accelerated the development of their products. We are committed to the best European digital talents. 

57 companies were supported, including 10 from Germany. In total, this meant more than one million euros for the German Open Data ecosystem.
