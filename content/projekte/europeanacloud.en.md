Europeana Cloud is a 'best practice network' aiming at establishing a cloud-based system for the European and national data aggregators in order to develop tools that can not only describe metadata, but make actual digital content connected, accessible, and editable.
We developed software solutions for editing metadata and digital content in a cloud-based infrastructure for this project.
