The Turing Bus is a mobile educational service for schools and youth clubs in rural areas. The bus brings representatives of Fablabs, OK-Labs and Hackspaces as well as experts in digital topics to often underserved places of youth education in order to generate an exchange of knowledge through workshops, discussion formats, screenings and more. The project is funded in the science year 2018 - "Workplaces of the Future". 

The bus wants to explore, discuss and critically question the role of digitisation and technology for profession and society with workshops, lectures and hands-on sessions. The target group of the project are young people between the ages of 15 and 20.
