Fiscal Transparency, Risk Assessment and Impact of Good Governance Policies Assessed.

The allocation of funds through public procurement (services, bulding contracts, and goods) represents a significant share of state expenditure. In the EU, this amounts to about 16% of the GDP. In many cases, the allocation of these contracts is not conducted transparently. As a result, 20-25% of the total number of orders can be lost to corruption.

In order to change this, we are working together with 5 partners on the EU project, DIGIWHIST. We not only aim to increase the level of trust placed in governments, we also intend to make public procurement in Europe more efficient. To do so, we are systematically collecting, structuring, and analyzing information on public procurement.

We are developing up to 35 procurement portals (for the 34 countries and one combined with all available data) that will provide the following main functions:

* downloadable database and documentation
* user-friendly, interactive analysis tools
* allowing users for accessing data and sending whistleblower reports and freedom of information requests of platforms of national partners.
