The corporate registry is the public repository of companies, foundations and associations in Germany. It contains data about legal status, address and officers of an entity.

This data is important for trust in business and the people involved. However, this data is not made openly accessible by the government.

Together with [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) we published the German corporate registry as open data for the first time.
