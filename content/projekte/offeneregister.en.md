The corporate registry is the public repository of companies, foundations and associations in Germany. It contains data about legal status, address and officers of an entity.

This data is important for the trust in business and the people involved. But this data is not made openly accessible by the government.

Together with [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) we publish the German corporate registry as Open Data for the first time.
