The "Wahl.Daten.Helfer." was originally a platform on which hackathons can be announced for elections. We not only wanted to deal with current election data, but also develop toolkits and apps for upcoming elections, which can be easily adapted and used for example for the European elections.

The project was continued as a community project with an extended focus. The Wahl.Daten.Helfer now helps you to inform yourself about parties and their programs.
