The majority (>85%) of our income comes from public funds. We obtain these funds through public tenders, funding programmes and research work. Individual donations correspond to approximately 1% of our income. The private sector currently provides 4,74% of our funds. We strive our to maintain diverse funding streams with a small private sector share.
