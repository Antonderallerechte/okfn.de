Most of our spendings are linked to the implementation of projects and the organisation of events. We try to keep fixed costs (non project-related expenditure) low. Rent, ancillary costs for the Berlin office and server expenses represent the majority of such costs.

In 2019, on average, we employed 32 people, but not all of them were full-time staff. 27 team members worked directly from our Berlin office, and five additional team members worked from our labs in Ulm and FÃ¼rstenberg or from the Berlin OGP office.
